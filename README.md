# AI Photo Editing with Inpainting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **AI-based Photo Editing using Inpainting**. The project focuses on using artificial intelligence to restore or edit images by filling in missing or damaged parts, a technique known as **inpainting**. This approach can be used for tasks such as object removal, image restoration, and photo enhancements.

## Overview

The AI Photo Editing project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to perform inpainting on images. It uses models trained to predict and generate missing parts of an image based on the surrounding context. The notebook walks through the process of loading images, applying inpainting algorithms, and evaluating the results.

### Key Features

- **Inpainting with Deep Learning**: Utilizes AI models to restore or edit images by filling in missing areas.
- **Image Restoration**: Can be used for removing objects, repairing damaged photos, or enhancing images.
- **Customizable**: The inpainting model can be fine-tuned for specific image-editing tasks.

## Files in the Repository

- **AI Photo Editing with Inpainting.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the entire workflow for AI-based photo editing using inpainting, including loading images, applying the inpainting algorithm, and visualizing results.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-link>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r <libraries imported in notebook>
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to apply inpainting on sample images:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "AI Photo Editing with Inpainting.ipynb"
   ```

4. **Customize**:
   Modify the code to use your own images or adjust the inpainting parameters to suit your specific needs.
